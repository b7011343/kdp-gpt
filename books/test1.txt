['Chapter 1: The Unfortunate Roommate Shuffle\n\nJacob, Ben, and Mike were three British university students who were known for their lack of common sense and their uncanny ability to find themselves in the most absurd situations. They were inseparable, like three peas in a pod, and their misadventures were the stuff of legends on campus.\n\nThe story begins on a sunny September morning, as the trio eagerly awaited their new room assignments for the upcoming academic year. They had heard rumors of a legendary dormitory known as "The Den of Chaos," and they were determined to secure a spot there.\n\nAs they anxiously gathered in the housing office, the administrator called out their names one by one. Jacob was assigned to Room 101, Ben to Room 102, and Mike to Room 103. Disappointed, they realized they had been separated. Determined to rectify the situation, they hatched a plan.\n\nThey approached the administrator, a stern-looking woman named Mrs. Jenkins, and pleaded their case. "We\'re a package deal," Jacob explained, "We can\'t possibly survive without each other\'s stupidity to keep us entertained."\n\nMrs. Jenkins sighed, clearly unimpressed by their argument. "I\'m sorry, but the rooms have already been assigned. There\'s nothing I can do."\n\nUndeterred, the trio decided to take matters into their own hands. They devised a plan to swap rooms without anyone noticing. They reasoned that if they could successfully execute the switch, they would be able to continue their shenanigans together.\n\nThat night, under the cover of darkness, they put their plan into action. Armed with a set of identical room keys, they tiptoed through the dimly lit corridors, careful not to wake any of the other students.\n\nAs they reached the designated floor, they realized they had forgotten one crucial detail – they had no idea which room belonged to whom. Panic set in as they stood in front of the three identical doors, scratching their heads.\n\n"Wait a minute," Ben exclaimed, a mischievous glint in his eye. "I have an idea. Let\'s use our unique talents to figure out who belongs where."\n\nJacob, the absent-minded one, was tasked with finding the room with the most clutter. Ben, the perpetually hungry one, was assigned to locate the room with the distinct smell of leftover pizza. And Mike, the perpetually lost one, was given the responsibility of finding the room with the most confusing layout.\n\nAfter a series of comical mishaps, including Jacob mistaking a janitor\'s closet for his room and Mike getting trapped in a bathroom stall, they finally managed to sort out the correct room assignments.\n\nAs they settled into their new rooms, the trio couldn\'t help but laugh at the absurdity of their situation. They realized that even though they were physically separated, their bond remained unbreakable.\n\nLittle did they know that their misadventures were just beginning. From accidentally flooding the bathroom to setting off the fire alarm during a failed cooking experiment, their time in "The Den of Chaos" would be filled with laughter, chaos, and a whole lot of dumb decisions.\n\nAnd so, as they drifted off to sleep that night, they couldn\'t help but feel excited for the adventures that awaited them in their new, albeit slightly mixed-up, living arrangements.', "Chapter 2: The Great Library Debacle\n\nJacob, Ben, and Mike found themselves in the midst of another hilarious misadventure. This time, their escapade took place in the university library, a place known for its strict rules and silent atmosphere.\n\nIt all started when Jacob, the self-proclaimed genius of the trio, decided to impress a girl he had a crush on by pretending to be a bookworm. He convinced Ben and Mike to join him in the library, promising them that it would be a quiet and peaceful place to study.\n\nAs they entered the library, the three friends were immediately overwhelmed by the silence and the stern looks from the librarians. Jacob, determined to maintain his facade, shushed his friends and motioned for them to follow him to a secluded corner.\n\nUnbeknownst to Jacob, Ben had a notorious reputation for being clumsy. As they tiptoed through the aisles, Ben accidentally knocked over a stack of books, causing a loud crash that echoed throughout the library. The trio froze, their eyes wide with panic.\n\nThe librarians, who were already on high alert due to the noise, rushed towards the commotion. Jacob, quick on his feet, grabbed Ben and Mike and pulled them into a nearby study room, hoping to avoid getting caught.\n\nInside the study room, the three friends tried to catch their breath and come up with a plan. Mike, always the prankster, suggested they disguise themselves as librarians to blend in and avoid suspicion. Jacob, desperate to salvage his reputation, reluctantly agreed.\n\nThey rummaged through the room, finding old librarian uniforms and glasses. With a stroke of luck, they even stumbled upon a cart filled with books waiting to be shelved. They quickly changed into the uniforms and pushed the cart out into the library, pretending to be diligent librarians.\n\nAs they went about their charade, Jacob, Ben, and Mike struggled to maintain their composure. Ben kept tripping over his own feet, knocking over more books and drawing attention to themselves. Mike, trying to stifle his laughter, accidentally sprayed a librarian with a water bottle, mistaking it for a bottle of air freshener.\n\nThe chaos continued to escalate, with the librarians growing increasingly suspicious of the trio's behavior. Jacob, realizing their cover was about to be blown, decided it was time to make a swift exit.\n\nHe signaled to Ben and Mike, and they abandoned the cart, leaving a trail of books in their wake. They sprinted towards the library exit, narrowly avoiding capture by the librarians.\n\nOutside, they collapsed onto a nearby bench, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. Their attempt to impress a girl had turned into a hilarious disaster, but they couldn't help but find the whole situation absurdly funny.\n\nAs they caught their breath, Jacob, Ben, and Mike vowed to never set foot in the library again. Little did they know, their adventures were far from over, and more comedic chaos awaited them in the chapters to come.", 'Chapter 3: The Great Prank War\n\nJacob, Ben, and Mike had always been mischievous, but their latest adventure took their antics to a whole new level. It all started innocently enough, with Jacob discovering a hidden stash of water balloons in their dorm room. The trio\'s eyes lit up with mischief as they realized the potential for a grand prank.\n\nThey decided to initiate a prank war with their neighboring dorm, which was occupied by a group of equally mischievous students. The rules were simple: each side had to come up with the most creative and outrageous pranks possible, and the first team to surrender would be declared the loser.\n\nThe next morning, Jacob, Ben, and Mike gathered in their room, brainstorming ideas for their first strike. Ben suggested filling the hallway with foam, while Mike proposed turning the common room into a giant ball pit. But it was Jacob who came up with the ultimate prank – a fake alien invasion.\n\nThey spent the entire day gathering materials and constructing their elaborate plan. They created a life-sized alien figure out of papier-mâché, complete with glowing eyes and a smoke machine hidden inside. They strategically placed the alien in the middle of the courtyard, ensuring maximum visibility.\n\nAs night fell, the trio nervously awaited the reactions of their unsuspecting victims. They watched from their dorm room window, stifling laughter as students stumbled upon the alien figure. Screams of terror echoed through the night as the prank took full effect.\n\nThe next morning, news of the alien invasion spread like wildfire across campus. Students were buzzing with excitement and fear, unsure of what to believe. The university authorities were in a frenzy, trying to calm the panicked students and investigate the incident.\n\nJacob, Ben, and Mike reveled in their success, but little did they know that their rivals were not ones to back down easily. The neighboring dorm retaliated with a prank of their own – they turned the trio\'s room into a jungle, complete with live animals and vines hanging from the ceiling.\n\nThe dumbfounded trio stood at the doorway, staring in disbelief at the chaos that awaited them. Jacob\'s jaw dropped as he spotted a monkey swinging from his desk lamp, while Ben tried to shoo away a parrot perched on his shoulder. Mike, on the other hand, found himself entangled in a web of vines, struggling to break free.\n\nThe prank war escalated with each passing day, with both sides going to extreme lengths to outdo each other. The campus became a battleground of laughter and chaos, as students eagerly awaited the next prank. From turning the library into a disco party to filling the lecture halls with balloons, there seemed to be no limit to their creativity.\n\nAs the pranks grew more elaborate, so did the bond between Jacob, Ben, and Mike. They realized that their friendship was strengthened by their shared love for mischief and laughter. And even though they were often labeled as "dumb," they proved that sometimes, it\'s the foolish ones who have the most fun.\n\nLittle did they know, their prank war was about to take an unexpected turn, leading them on a wild adventure that would test their friendship and their ability to think on their feet. But that\'s a story for another chapter.', "Chapter 4: The Great Prank War\n\nJacob, Ben, and Mike had always been mischievous, but their latest adventure took their pranks to a whole new level.

Armed with water balloons, they tiptoed to the neighboring dorm and carefully positioned themselves outside the windows. With a nod from Jacob, they let the water balloons fly, drenching the unsuspecting students inside.\n\nThe prank war escalated quickly. The neighboring dorm retaliated by filling Jacob, Ben, and Mike's room with balloons, turning it into a colorful, bouncy castle. Not to be outdone, our trio responded by covering the neighboring dorm's entrance with cling wrap, causing a hilarious series of collisions as students stumbled into the invisible barrier.\n\nThe pranks continued to escalate, with each side trying to outdo the other. Jacob, Ben, and Mike filled the neighboring dorm's showerheads with colored dye, turning the students into walking rainbows.

The university's dean requested their presence in his office.

However, his costume ends up looking more like a bedsheet with a hastily drawn "S" on it. Ben, on the other hand, opts for a last-minute costume, throwing on a bedsheet and claiming to be a ghost.
